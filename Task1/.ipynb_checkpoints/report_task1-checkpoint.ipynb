    "In this task, we generated adversarial examples in the context of the zero-knowledge threat model using 2 different attack methods: FGSM(Fast Gradient Sign Method) and PGD(Projected Gradient Descent). For each type of attack, we generate adversarial examples with five various epsilons (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,0.4, and 0.5). We also evaluated the generated adversarial examples on the undefended model, the vanilla Athena, and PGD-ADT. The success rate (??)of each adversarial example was reported in the evaluation section of the report.\n"

    "\n",
    "We used two types of attacks to generate adversarial examples. \"FGSM\" (fast gradient sign method) and \"PGD\" (projected gradient descent). The examples were generated in the context of a zero-knowledge threat model, meaning the attacks had no knowledge of the defense. We used five different variants of each attack, setting the epsilon value to 0.1-0.5, which represent the degree of attack pertubation.\n",
